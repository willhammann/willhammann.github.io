            <p>Over the last decade, Maryland has shifted its policies for youth who find themselves tied up in the justice system. The state has turned away from costly and potentially harmful incarceration and in its place, expanded the use of diversion programs–community-based and initiatives that strive to rehabilitate youth by targeting the root causes of delinquent behavior, such as trauma or unstable housing. This trend, mirrored nationally, reflects a growing recognition that helping young people treat others better is easier without throwing them into a cell.</p>

            <h3>Trending Away From Detention</h3>
            <div class="row">

                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-3 d-flex align-items-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">According to data from the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, juvenile complaints for non-violent felonies and misdemeanors have fallen more than two thirds, and complaints for crimes of violence fell 57.9% from 2012 to 2021. This shows that moving toward diversion has not led to more crime, and suggesting that public safety can be maintained without relying on detention. This shift is illustrated by the fact that the amount of youth incarcerated fell by 75% from 2000 and 2022 according to The Sentencing Project. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-3 d-flex align-items-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">Not only are fewer youths being incarcerated, but of those who are, a smaller proportion of them were incarcerated for non-violent crime. Incarceration is often justified by mitigating danger to the public posed by delinquents, but when risk is low there is little reason for incarceration.</p>

            <h3>Why Diversion? Cost and Rates of Recidivism</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-9">
                    <img src="img/final_cost.png" alt="chart" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-3 d-flex align-items-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">Lower cost is likely the most tangible benefit of diversion as an alternative to incarceration. Yearly costs of incarcerating a youth in Maryland are more than $414,000 per child, a number that nearly doubles the national average of $214,000. The yearly cost of diversion programs on the other hand cost roughly only $4,000 per child.</p>

            <div class="row">

                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-3 d-flex align-items-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">Another benefit proven by various studies is lower rates of recidivism among youth following their exit from diversion than from detention. Teen Court programs in Baltimore City, Charles County, and Montgomery County have shown that participants are 2.5 to 6 times less likely to reoffend compared to peers processed through traditional juvenile justice systems. Numbers aside, the ability to keep youth connected to school, family and community while receiving uplifting support is instrumental to effective rehabilitation. Incarceration is degrading in that it isolates youth from all those things and exposes them to a harsh and potentially harmful environment. </p>

            <h3>Challenges Ahead: Equity and Investment</h3>
            <p>The most glaring flaw that blemishes the generally positive trends of youth justice over the last decade is the disproportionate representation of Black youth in the justice system. They are more frequently the subject of juvenile complaints and are more likely to be held in detention regardless of their crime. This has remained stagnant despite the overall reductions in juvenile crime and detention.</p>
            <p>Additionally, diversion programs often face inconsistent funding. While detention centers are generally entirely funded by state budgets on a consistent basis, non-residential alternatives typically rely on grants or local initiatives.</p>
            <p>Maryland has come a long way and has already started to see the benefits of adopting a more rehabilitative and cost-effective youth justice system. Still, the potential of diversion programs cannot be fully realized until they receive more significant and consistent investment, and the state will need to prioritize equity to ensure that all youth have access to alternatives that lift them up instead of locking them away, regardless of their race.</p>

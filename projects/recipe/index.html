    <h1>Banana Bread</h1>
    <p>With overripe bananas, applesauce, and vanilla extract, this classic banana bread is soft, flavorful, and
        incredibly moist. I tested this recipe a dozen times to make the best banana bread with amazing banana flavor
        and only a little fat. Whether you’re a seasoned baker or a newbie, this is perfect for any occasion, such as
        breakfast, back-to-school snacks, or even as a sweet gift.</p>
    <h2>Why you'll love this recipe:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Healthy:</b> I swap the oil or butter for applesauce, making this loaf much lighter than most banana
            bread recipes.</li>
        <li><b>Easy:</b> This quick bread is quick and easy! You don’t have to wait for it to rise. Just mix the
            ingredients and bake.</li>
        <li><b>Make It Ahead:</b> Banana bread is perfect for meal prep. It’ll last all week in your fridge or freezer.
        </li>
        <li><b>Dairy-Free:</b> I used coconut oil instead of butter to keep it allergy-friendly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Baking Spray</li>
        <li>3 large ripe bananas, (11 oz in weight or 1 1/3 cup total), mashed chunky with fork</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose flour, (8 ounces total weight)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil, butter works too</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar, I used Lakanto monk fruit 3.2 oz</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 8×5 inch loaf pan with baking spray.</p>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the dry ingredients; flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt with a wire whisk. Set
        aside.</p>
    <p>In a large bowl cream coconut oil, apple sauce and sugar with an electric mixer or stand mixer. Add egg and
        vanilla, and beat at medium speed until thick.</p>
    <p>Scrape down sides of the bowl.</p>
    <p>Add 1/2 of the dry ingredients and blend at low speed until combined, add remaining 1/2 of the dry ingredients
        and the mashed bananas and blend at low speed until batter is combined. Do not over mix.</p>
    <p>Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake on the center rack for about 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick
        inserted in the center comes out clean, but moist.</p>
    <p>Let the pan cool at least 10 minutes, bread should be room temperature before slicing.</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>How to ripen bananas quicker</h3>
    <p>Place bananas in a paper bag and leave them in a warm area for quicker ripening. When the peels get spotted and
        blacken slightly, and become soft they will be ready.</p>
    <h3>How to store banana bread</h3>
    <p>Once the bread cools, store it in an airtight container for one day on the counter and then in the fridge for up
        to a week.</p>
